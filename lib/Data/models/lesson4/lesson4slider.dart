That’s why they were accepted by all and assumed the role of currency we know now, circulating as an element of exchange for other products and used to assess their value.Cattle was one of the mostly used, and had the advantages of moving for itself, reproducing and rendering services, although there was the risk of diseases and death. Sometimes salt was also used as a commodity money."),

The deben’s function was to let people know the price of things, except that there was no deben coin, the deben was approximately 90 grams of copper very expensive items could also be priced in debens of silver or gold with proportionate changes in value so if a duck costs one deben, and a papyrus scroll was also worth one deben, the duck could be traded fairly for the papyrus scroll. Salary of workers was also calculated in the same manner."),

Also it is often perishable and bulky. Cattle were used frequently as commodity currency in agrarian/farming societies, they worked well as a medium of trade because everyone in that society placed value on them but they were hard to transport. But to a city dweller, the cattle won’t have much value."),
